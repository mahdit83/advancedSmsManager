# Advanced Sms Manager
AdvancedSmsManager is library for sending sms for single and two sim-card phones. it is very handy and usefull. It's two-sim mode works on Android.SDK > 21. For lower SDKs it send sms from default sim.
For using in android studio add this to your dependency:

```groovy
compile 'ir.mtajik.android:advancedsmsmanager:1.0.5'                    
```
Before using SmsHandler you had to permit user with `Manifest.permission.SEND_SMS` and `Manifest.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE` . 
    
After that simply call sendSms that have a Interface for all callbacks. smsId is a random unique auto generated Id that generated for every single sms that created by your app.
In version 1.0.5 , i implement Builder design pattern. All the ```with``` parameters are optional. 
```java

SmsHandler.builder(context, "+989120000000")
                .withCarrierNameFilter("MCI")
                .withCustomDialogForSendSms(R.layout.my_sms_dialog)
                .withCustomDialogForChoseSim(R.layout.simcard_choosing_dialog)
                .needToShowDialog(false)
                .build().sendSms(DIALOG_MESSAGE, SMS_BODY, new MySmsManager.SMSManagerCallBack() {
            @Override
            public void afterSuccessfulSMS(int smsId) {

            }

            @Override
            public void afterDelivered(int smsId) {

            }

            @Override
            public void afterUnSuccessfulSMS(int smsId, String message) {

            }

            @Override
            public void onCarrierNameNotMatch(int smsId, String message) {

            }
        });
```
If you do not want to ask user for send sms after premitted, put ```.needToShowDialog(false)``` or else leave it and sms confirem dialog will be displayed. Mention that sim chose dialog on two sim phones will always diplayed. Also you can inflate you custom view for both **sendSmsDialog** and **simChoseDialog** but  mention that they must have these component and ids. ( Extended components from these components are acceptable) 

for **sendSmsDialog**:
```xml
<Button
	android:id="@+id/send_button"
	...
           />
            
<Button
	android:id="@+id/cancel_button"
	...
           />

<TextView
        android:id="@+id/dialog_title"
        ...
          />

<ProgressBar
        android:id="@+id/progressBar_total"
	...
	   />
```           

and for **simChoseDialog** :
```xml
<Button
	android:id="@+id/sim1_button"
	...
           />
            
<Button
	android:id="@+id/sim2_button"
	...
           />

<TextView
        android:id="@+id/dialog_title"
        ...
          />
```  

This library created with MVP architecture and Uses Dagger2 as DI container with these dependencies:

```groovy
compile 'com.google.dagger:dagger:2.7'
annotationProcessor 'com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:2.7'
```           
           
So if you use dagger2 make sure that use compatible dependencies. I hope this library would be useful and wait for your comments.
